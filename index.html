		 I am an ordinary 21 year old girl with a driving licence who loves laughing! Simple and funny, I am interested in many things. I don't really know where to start, so I'll let you scroll through my profile to find out a little more...🤡

    	<h2>📆What is my background?📆</h2>
	    <p>
		 High School/College Sainte Marie d'Antony in 92 and I obtained my baccalaureate in 2017 in Social Economics. Since 2017, I am studying in IESEG School of Management where, in 2020, I joined the Master's Degree in Digital Marketing. From July to December 2019 I went to Colombia where I joined the Universidad Javeriana de Cali.

    	<h2>💵My little jobs💶</h2>
	    <p>
		 I worked in 2018 as a receptionist at a campsite for 2 months, where I was able to work on my patience and organisation. In 2019 and 2020, I worked as a sales consultant at Les Couronnes de Victoire where I was able to discover responsibilities and adaptation. From 2018 to today, I am a hostess at Mahola where I put forward my punctuality and helpfulness!

    	<h2>✈️Where did i go?✈️</h2>
	    <p>
		 My last trip was my university exchange in Colombia, where I was able to improve my Spanish. I also travelled to Romania, which is the country where my mother was born. I travelled a large part of the United States and England where I had English classes. I love visiting islands like Mauritius, which is a paradise on earth!

    	<h2>💬What about my languages?💬</h2>
	    <p>
		 French is my native language, Romanian too, my grandmother only speaks to me in Romanian! I'm not doing too badly in English, fortunately otherwise I wouldn't understand any of the lessons, and Spanish has become a fairly easy language for me since my exchange! I'm learning sign language little by little!

    	<h2>⛱And during my free time?⛱</h2>
	    <p>
		 I love to write everything that comes into my head between emotions and inventions. My secret bubble? I spend three-quarters of my time on series. I see my friends, I go out. My best hobby? My dog, we're inseparable!
